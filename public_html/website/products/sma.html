            Put simply, a social media strategy is a plan that outlines your social media goals, the tactics used to achieve them and metrics tracked to measure performance.
            
            Your strategy doesn’t need to be complicated. What you want is a simple and specific plan with meaningful measurables. This will help you to identify the channels and tactics that are successful, versus those that fall flat.

            Ultimately, your social media strategy should drive brand awareness and engagement across social media channels for your target audience/s. 
            
           <br><br> <h4>What are the benefits of having a social media strategy?</h4>
            You may have run a successful social media campaign or great engagement on your posted content. That one-off success is achievable. However, the difficult part of social media marketing is consistency. Do you understand why that campaign or post succeeded? Can you replicate it easily?
            
            It may be daunting to think about creating a social media strategy, but it will provide your business with many tangible benefits, like:
            <ul>
            <li>A direction for all your social media activities</li>
            <li>Improve brand awareness</li>
            <li>Offer social customer service and support</li>
            <li>Enhance targeting across audiences</li>
            <li>Direct and increase website traffic</li>
            <li>Personalize content</li>
            <li>Generate better quality leads</li>
            <li>Create social media influencer opportunities </li>
            <li>Promote your unique content that could go viral (remember the ALS ice bucket challenge?)</li>
            <li>Offer social commerce and shoppable posts</li>
            <li>Data you can analyze and measure</li>
        </ul>
            As you can see there are huge benefits to social media, so creating a strategy will serve to achieve your business goals and drive customer engagement.</p>

           <h4> What is a social media engagement strategy?</h4>
            Your social media engagement strategy is important as it creates connections with your audience across networks. It helps you to manage your community through social media channels and build your brand. 
            
            The two core purposes of an engagement strategy are to:
            <ul>
           <li> Manage your community: this can be done by offering advice through a blog, responding to comments in posts, replying to queries on channels, and reaching out with polls or surveys to find out more about your customer base. </li>
           <li>Grow your following: interaction is important here, so offer content that is valuable such as engaging video content, engage prospects with free content or competition offers or simply demonstrate your brand as active and useful by being responsive on your networks to draw people in.</li>
        </ul>
            User-generated content (UGC) can play a key role here as it’s evidence of the people that support your brand talking about it, rather than it coming from your business or marketing team. Here are four great UGC examples you can take inspiration from.
